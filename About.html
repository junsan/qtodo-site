          <p style="text-align: left;">Q-Todo Privacy Policy<br id="isPasted">
            <br>This privacy policy (“Privacy Policy”) governs how we, Q-Todo Inc. and its affiliates (“Q-Todo” “we”, “our” or “us”) use, collect and store information pertaining to you (“User”, “you”), such as in the following use cases:<br>
            <br>When you browse or visit our website, http://www.qtodo.store (“Website”);<br>
            <br>When you make use of, or interact with, our Website / application(s) / service(s), and the services provided thereunder (collectively referred to as the&nbsp;“Services”):<br>
            <br>When you create an account and login<br>
            <br>When you make use of our services as a registered user<br>
            <br>When you contact us (e.g. customer support, help, submit a request)<br>
            <br>When you exchange business cards with us<br>
            <br>When we use the Personal Data of our service providers<br>
            <br>When we use the Personal Data of our customers<br>
            <br>We greatly respect your privacy, which is why we make every effort to provide a platform that would live up to the highest of user privacy standards. Please read this Privacy Policy carefully, so you can fully understand our practices in relation to Personal Data. “Personal Data” means any information that can be used, alone or together with other data, to uniquely identify any living human being. Please note that this is a master privacy policy and some of its provisions only apply to individuals in certain jurisdictions. For example, the legal basis in the table below is only relevant for GDPR-protected individuals.<br>
            <br>This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time and therefore we ask you to check back periodically for the latest version of the Privacy Policy, as indicated below. If there will be any significant changes made to the use of your Personal Data in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection, we will notify you by posting a notice on our Website or by other means.<br>
            <br>1. What information we collect, why we collect it, and how it is used<br>
            <br>When you create an account and make use of our services as a registered user&nbsp;When you browse or visit our website&nbsp;When you contact us (e.g. customer support, help, submit a request)&nbsp;When we process your job application<br>
            <br>2. How we protect and store your personal data<br>
            <br>Security. We have implemented appropriate technical, organizational and security measures designed to reduce the risk of accidental destruction or loss, or the unauthorized disclosure or access to such information appropriate to the nature of the information concerned. However, please note that we cannot guarantee that the information will not be exposed as a result of unauthorized penetration to our servers. As the security of information depends in part on the security of the computer, device or network you use to communicate with us and the security you use to protect your user IDs and passwords, please make sure to take appropriate measures to protect this information.<br>
            <br>Retention of your Personal Data. In addition to the retention periods mentioned in Section 1 above, in some circumstances we may store your Personal Data for longer periods of time, for example (i) where we are required to do so in accordance with legal, regulatory, tax or accounting requirements, or (ii) for us to have an accurate record of your dealings with us in the event of any complaints or challenges, or (iii) if we reasonably believe there is a prospect of litigation relating to your Personal Data or dealings.<br>
            <br>3. How we share your personal data<br>
            <br>In addition to the recipients described in Section 1, we may share your information as follows:<br>
            <br>To the extent necessary, with regulators, to comply with all applicable laws, regulations and rules, and requests of law enforcement, regulatory and other governmental agencies or if required to do so by court order;<br>
            <br>If, in the future, we sell or transfer some or all of our business or assets to a third party, we will (to the minimum extent required) disclose information to a potential or actual third party purchaser of our business or assets. In the event that we are acquired by or merged with a third party entity, or in the event of bankruptcy or a comparable event, we reserve the right to transfer or assign Personal Data in connection with the foregoing events.<br>
            <br>Where you have provided your consent to us sharing the Personal Data (e.g., where you provide us with marketing consents or opt-in to optional additional services or functionality); and<br>
            <br>Where we receive requests for information from law enforcement or regulators, we carefully validate these requests before any Personal Data is disclosed.
